            <h2>Why Accessibility Matters</h2>
            <p>Web accessibility ensures that websites and applications can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. Over one billion people worldwide have some form of disability, and inaccessible websites exclude them from digital experiences. Beyond the moral imperative, accessibility is often legally required, improves SEO, and creates better user experiences for all users.</p>
            <p>Accessibility isn't just about compliance—it's about inclusion. When websites are built with accessibility in mind, they work better for everyone. Keyboard navigation benefits users with motor disabilities, but also power users who prefer keyboard shortcuts. Clear structure helps screen reader users, but also improves SEO and makes content easier to scan for all users.</p>

            <h2>Understanding WCAG Guidelines</h2>
            <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are the international standard for web accessibility. Developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), WCAG provides a comprehensive framework for creating accessible web content. The guidelines are organized around four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR).</p>
            <p>WCAG has three levels of conformance: A (minimum), AA (recommended), and AAA (enhanced). Most organizations aim for AA compliance, which addresses the majority of accessibility barriers while remaining practical to implement. Level A provides basic accessibility, while AAA represents the highest level of accessibility support.</p>
            <p>Each guideline includes specific success criteria that can be tested. For example, "Images must have alternative text" is a Level A requirement. "Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information" is a Level A requirement that ensures information is accessible to colorblind users.</p>

            <h2>Perceivable: Making Content Accessible to Senses</h2>
            <p>The Perceivable principle ensures that users can perceive content through at least one of their senses. This includes providing text alternatives for images, captions for videos, and ensuring sufficient color contrast. Text alternatives allow screen readers to describe images to users who cannot see them.</p>
            <p>Color contrast is crucial for readability. WCAG requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (Level AA). Tools like WebAIM's Contrast Checker can help developers verify that their color choices meet these requirements. Poor contrast affects not just users with visual impairments, but also anyone viewing content in bright sunlight or on low-quality displays.</p>
            <p>Multimedia content requires captions and transcripts. Video captions help users who are deaf or hard of hearing, while transcripts provide an alternative format that's also useful for SEO and users who prefer reading to watching. Audio descriptions can help users with visual impairments understand visual elements in videos.</p>

            <h2>Operable: Ensuring User Interface Components Work</h2>
            <p>The Operable principle ensures that users can interact with interface components. This includes keyboard accessibility, providing enough time to read and use content, and avoiding content that could cause seizures. All functionality must be available through keyboard navigation, not just mouse clicks.</p>
            <p>Keyboard navigation is fundamental to accessibility. Users with motor disabilities, repetitive strain injuries, or those who simply prefer keyboards must be able to access all interactive elements. Focus indicators should be visible and logical, following a clear tab order. Skip links allow users to bypass repetitive navigation and jump to main content.</p>
            <p>Time-based content must be adjustable or pausable. Users with cognitive disabilities or those who need more time to read should be able to extend time limits. Auto-playing content should be controllable, and users should be able to pause, stop, or hide moving, blinking, or scrolling content.</p>

            <h2>Understandable: Making Content Clear and Predictable</h2>
            <p>The Understandable principle ensures that content and interface operation are clear. This includes readable text, predictable functionality, and input assistance. Language should be as simple as possible, and technical terms should be explained. Reading level should match the intended audience.</p>
            <p>Predictable navigation and functionality help all users, but are especially important for users with cognitive disabilities. Consistent navigation, clear headings, and logical page structure make websites easier to understand and use. Error messages should be clear and suggest solutions.</p>
            <p>Form inputs should have clear labels, and errors should be identified and described. Required fields should be clearly marked, and validation should occur in real-time when possible. Help text and examples can guide users through complex forms.</p>

            <h2>Robust: Ensuring Compatibility with Assistive Technologies</h2>
            <p>The Robust principle ensures that content can be interpreted reliably by assistive technologies. This includes using valid HTML, proper semantic markup, and ensuring that custom components work with screen readers and other assistive tools. Valid markup is the foundation of accessibility.</p>
            <p>Semantic HTML provides meaning to content. Using proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3) helps screen reader users navigate. Lists should use proper list elements, not just styled divs. Form elements should be properly associated with labels. These semantic elements provide structure that assistive technologies can understand.</p>
            <p>When custom components are necessary, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes can bridge the gap between custom implementations and assistive technology expectations. However, native HTML elements should be preferred when they provide the needed functionality.</p>

            <h2>ARIA: Enhancing Accessibility for Dynamic Content</h2>
            <p>ARIA attributes provide additional information to assistive technologies when HTML semantics aren't sufficient. ARIA roles describe what an element is or does, ARIA properties provide additional information, and ARIA states describe current conditions. ARIA should be used to enhance, not replace, semantic HTML.</p>
            <p>Common ARIA roles include "button" for clickable elements that aren't buttons, "dialog" for modal windows, and "navigation" for navigation regions. ARIA properties like "aria-label" provide accessible names when visible text isn't sufficient. ARIA states like "aria-expanded" indicate whether collapsible content is open or closed.</p>
            <p>ARIA live regions allow screen readers to announce dynamic content changes. This is essential for single-page applications where content updates without page reloads. Proper use of aria-live ensures that users are informed of important changes, such as form validation messages or new content loading.</p>

            <h2>Testing for Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Accessibility testing should be integrated into the development process. Automated tools can catch many issues, but manual testing with assistive technologies is essential. Screen readers like NVDA (Windows), JAWS (Windows), or VoiceOver (Mac) should be used to test websites.</p>
            <p>Keyboard-only navigation testing ensures that all functionality is accessible without a mouse. Color contrast checkers verify that text meets WCAG requirements. Browser developer tools can identify many accessibility issues, and extensions like axe DevTools provide comprehensive automated testing.</p>
            <p>User testing with people who have disabilities provides the most valuable feedback. Real users can identify issues that automated tools miss and provide insights into usability that go beyond technical compliance. This testing should be conducted throughout the development process, not just before launch.</p>

            <h2>Common Accessibility Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h2>
            <p>Many accessibility issues stem from simple oversights. Missing alt text on images is one of the most common problems. Every image should have meaningful alt text unless it's purely decorative, in which case it should have an empty alt attribute. Alt text should describe the image's purpose, not just its appearance.</p>
            <p>Poor color contrast is another frequent issue. Designers and developers should check contrast ratios early in the design process. Color should never be the only way to convey information—icons, text, or patterns should supplement color coding.</p>
            <p>Keyboard navigation problems often arise from custom components that don't properly handle focus. Focus management is crucial for modals, dropdowns, and other dynamic content. Focus should move logically through interactive elements and be clearly visible.</p>

            <h2>Building an Accessible Future</h2>
            <p>Accessibility should be considered from the beginning of every project, not added as an afterthought. When accessibility is integrated into design and development processes, it becomes easier to implement and maintain. Training teams on accessibility principles and best practices creates a culture of inclusion.</p>
            <p>Frameworks and libraries are increasingly including accessibility features by default. React's accessibility features, Vue's accessibility guidelines, and Angular's accessibility documentation help developers build accessible applications more easily. However, developers must still understand accessibility principles to use these tools effectively.</p>
            <p>As web technologies evolve, accessibility standards and best practices continue to develop. Staying informed about WCAG updates, new ARIA features, and emerging assistive technologies ensures that websites remain accessible as technology advances. The goal is to create a web that works for everyone, regardless of ability.</p>
