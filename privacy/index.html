                <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in the following products and services (collectively, “Services”):</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>The JSON Formatter tool at <strong>https://jsonformatter.echologai.com</strong>.</li>

            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>2. Website Data (echologai.com)</h2>
                <p>Our main website provides information about EchoLog, our products, and our mission. We do not directly collect personally identifiable information from casual visitors unless you choose to contact us or otherwise provide information (for example, via linked forms such as Google Forms or Calendly). Any information you submit through those third-party services is handled according to their respective privacy policies.</p>
                <p>We may collect basic, non-identifying information automatically, such as your browser type, device type, and general interaction with the website (for example, which pages are visited). This information is used to maintain and improve the website experience.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>3. JSON Formatter Tool (jsonformatter.echologai.com)</h2>
                <p>The JSON Formatter tool allows you to paste, format, and validate JSON data in your browser.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your JSON input is processed <strong>locally in your browser</strong>. We do not send your JSON data to any server or external API.</li>
                    <li>We may use basic, browser-level storage (such as local storage or session storage) only to temporarily cache your recent inputs or preferences to improve your experience. This data stays on your device and is not transmitted to us.</li>
                    <li>We do not store, log, or retain your JSON content on our servers.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>4. Chrome Extension: EchoLog AI Voice Assistant</h2>
                <p>The EchoLog AI Voice Assistant Chrome extension is committed to protecting your privacy. This section explains how the extension handles data.</p>

                <h3>4.1 Data Collection</h3>
                <p>We do not collect, store, or share personal or sensitive user data from the extension for our own purposes. The extension operates primarily on your local device, and no data is transmitted to our own servers.</p>
                <p>To understand and respond to voice commands, the extension may send transient voice data or text transcripts to large language model APIs (such as Gemini APIs) solely for intent understanding. These APIs are used to process your commands and return responses. We do not build profiles or store this data for tracking purposes.</p>

                <h3>4.2 Permissions</h3>
                <p>The Chrome extension may request permissions such as microphone access to process voice commands. Microphone input is used only to capture your commands so the extension can perform the requested actions. The data is processed temporarily and is not recorded or stored by us.</p>

                <h3>4.3 Third-Party Services (Extension)</h3>
                <p>Apart from the AI APIs used to interpret your commands, we do not use additional third-party analytics or advertising within the Chrome extension. Your activity within the extension remains focused on providing assistive functionality.</p>
